# Catch the button

A button that runs away from your mouse.  First conceptualized in a group setting with [Elliot Humphrey](https://github.com/evhumphrey/button-thing), much later revisited and expanded on by me.

Button runs away from your mouse to a random new position but slows down slightly on every move until sucessfully clicked.
