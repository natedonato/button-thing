# Catch the button
[Play with live demo](https://natedonato.com/button-thing)

A button that runs away from you.  First conceptualized in a group setting together with [Elliot Humphrey](https://github.com/evhumphrey/button-thing).

Button moves to a random position any time the mouse gets close by, but slows down slightly on every move until sucessfully clicked.
On mobile devices button runs away from tap approximately five times before becoming triggerable.
